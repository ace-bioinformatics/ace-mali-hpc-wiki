title: Getting an Account

To use the ACE HPC Cluster, you must have an account. This page explains how to request and manage your account.

### Eligibility
- Faculty, staff, and students affiliated with ACE or partner institutions.
- External collaborators sponsored by an ACE faculty member.

To access the High Performance Computing (HPC) Cluster at the African Centre of Excellence in Bioinformatics and Data Intensive Sciences (ACE), users must request an account. Follow the steps below to apply for an ACE HPC account and complete the onboarding process.

### Step 1: Submit a Request via the ACE Ticketing System
All requests for ACE HPC accounts must be submitted through the ACE ticketing system by sending an email to `support@ace-bioinformatics.org`. Once granted access to the ticketing system, users are encouraged to check it frequently for updates on their requests or other HPC-related communications. Dave Ireland, a member of the support team, will guide users through the ticketing system to ensure a smooth experience.

**Note**: The ticketing system may be new to some users, and itâ€™s understood that there might be hesitation to use it. However, it is a critical tool for managing requests efficiently, and users are strongly encouraged to familiarize themselves with it. The support team is available to assist with any questions.

### Step 2: Complete the ACE HPC Account Request Form
After initiating a request in the ticketing system, users must fill out the ACE HPC Account Request Form. The form can be accessed here:

[ACE HPC Account Request Form](https://forms.gle/3URkjpjBcb6GDQZi9)

Ensure all required fields are completed accurately, as this information will be used to evaluate the request.

### Step 3: Form Review by the ACE Team
Once the form is submitted, the ACE HPC team will review it to confirm that all necessary details have been provided. The team will also assess whether the applicant has prior knowledge of Linux and SLURM, which are essential for using the cluster effectively.

### Step 4: Training for Users New to Linux and SLURM
If the review indicates that a user lacks experience with Linux and SLURM, the following training materials will be provided to help build the necessary skills:

- [Introduction to SLURM](https://github.com/acecancer/Session-materials/blob/main/Slurm.md)
- [Introduction to Linux Basics](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-linux-basics)

Users are required to study these materials thoroughly. Once completed, they should email the support team at [support@ace-bioinformatics.org](mailto:support@ace-bioinformatics.org) to confirm they have finished reviewing the resources. The team will then provide a quiz to assess understanding.

### Step 5: Complete the Linux and SLURM Quiz
After confirming completion of the training materials, users will receive a quiz to test their knowledge of Linux and SLURM. The quiz has a pass mark of 14 out of 15. If a user does not achieve the required score, they will be asked to review the materials again and retake the quiz until they pass.

### Step 6: Review and Sign the ACE HPC Policy
Upon passing the quiz, users will receive the ACE HPC Policy document, which outlines the rules and expectations for using the cluster. Users must read the policy carefully, paying special attention to the acknowledgment section, and adhere to its guidelines. A signed copy of the policy must be returned to the support team via email.

The support team will maintain a folder to store all signed copies of the policy for record-keeping. Users are encouraged to keep a copy of the policy for their reference.

### Step 7: Account Creation
Once the signed policy is received, the ACE HPC team will create an account for the user on the cluster.

### Step 8: Receive Account Details
After the account is created, users will receive an email containing their username, password, and other relevant account details. These credentials will allow access to the ACE HPC Cluster.
