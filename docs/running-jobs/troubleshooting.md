## Common Issues and Solutions

### üö´ Job Won‚Äôt Start

| Check                     | Explanation                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `squeue -u $USER`         | View your job's status in the queue. It might be waiting for resources.    |
| `scontrol show job <id>` | Get detailed info on job state, pending reasons, and requested resources.   |
| Resource Limits           | SLURM may delay your job if `--mem`, `--cpus`, or `--time` is too high.    |
| Partition Constraints     | Ensure you're submitting to the correct partition, if applicable.          |
| Node Availability         | Use `sinfo` to check if nodes are online and available.                    |

Try lowering resource requests temporarily or switching partitions (if available) to test submission.

### ‚ùå Job Fails Immediately

| Symptom                            | Solution                                                                 |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `.err` file has errors             | Always check this file for Python, R, Bash, or SLURM errors.             |
| "command not found"                | Ensure the right modules or environments are loaded in the script.       |
| Segmentation fault or core dump    | Likely a bug in your code or incompatible module‚Äîrun a smaller test.     |
| Permission denied                  | Check file and directory permissions in your script or input/output paths.|
| Syntax errors                      | Review your script syntax carefully (Bash/SLURM). Use `shellcheck` to lint.|

Also confirm that any scripts are executable:  
```bash
chmod +x script.sh
```

### üìÑ Helpful Debugging Tips
Add logging:
```bash
echo "Starting at $(date)"
```

Print environment:
```bash
env
```

Add `set -x` in bash scripts to trace execution.

### üõ† Debugging with an Interactive Session
You can test interactively before submitting a batch job:

```bash
salloc --time=01:00:00 --ntasks=1 --mem=4G
```
